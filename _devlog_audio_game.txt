# Add mouse drag / hover events for on-screen buttons
# (Play slide on click+drag)

Pressing keyboard keys works great (can press same key multiple times.)
But if I use mouse, I can't press the same key I just pressed.
Need to UNTOGGLE button on mouse release.

Update physical keyboard keys to behave the same way (release kills it.)
currently it's a bit buggy, it keeps re-triggering the event for some reason.

17 white notes
12 black notes

= 17 + 12 = 29 polyphony (32 will work)
send note to polyphonic player?
