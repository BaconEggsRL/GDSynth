GDSynth:
Real-time audio synthesis using Godot 4.4




=====================================================



Todo:

Practical / QOL improvements to make it easier to record/layer tracks:


METRONOME:
Built-in metronome with adjustable BPM and time signature


KNOB / BUTTON PRESETS:
Save multiple (named) A/S/D/R knob presets
0 decay sounds really cool with sus -10
(include wave/arp button settings as well?)


MUTLI-TRACK:
Add multiple record/loop track slots.












=====================================================


Stretch:

Arpeggiator:
UP: 1234
DOWN: 4321
UP+DOWN: 12344321
UP/DOWN: 123432
PLAYED_ORDER: plays arpeggio in key order played by the user****
RANDOM: random order (with repeats / without repeats)
CHORD: just pulses the held chord

Knobs:
# TEMPO -- control speed
OCTAVE -- control number of octaves to play on (will repeat held notes up/down octave.)
# GATE -- how long the note is held
# LATCH -- continue playing after keys are released
# (intelligent latch -- old chord latches, but goes away when a new chord is played.)

EFFECTS:
Fade effects in and out -- might be useful but not that important
Phaser -- not super important to add right now
realistic piano sounds? -- probably complicated

WAVE TABLE:
More complex oscillators (besides sine wave)
--Frequency modulation -- pulling peaks and valleys tighter together
--Phase modulation, phase distortion, wave folding
--wave table -- sine, triangle, saw, square
smooth morph between waveforms using LFO
--(low frequency oscillator -- changes the waveform over time.)



And text edit fields to enter your own values
Add an option to allow press white keys in black key area (disable mouse filter)



=====================================================

Bugs:

Popping sound on note start -- seems more prominent with low Attack
The pop is intermittent (doesn't always occur.)

Keys held by keyboard repeat when releasing a key held by mouse.

Output latency web: default is 50, max is 100? try tinkering

Looping still kind of weird
Fix weird buzzing on multiple frequencies (phase issue?)
--might just be audio clipping due to being too loud when layering multiple notes




=====================================================

17 white notes
12 black notes
= 17 + 12 = 29 polyphony (32 will work)
send note to polyphonic player for phase matching?


Changelog:
# Add A/S/D/R functions.
# Add a loop button to loop recorded tracks.
# Add mouse drag / hover events for on-screen buttons
# (Play slide on click+drag)

# Add multitouch support for mobile (switch to touch screen button?)
# Fix interactions between keypress and touch

# Octave slider (change octaves)
# Pitch bend

# piano--7 octaves (of C) = 49 + 2 = 51
# black: 7 octaves (of B flat) = 49
# 51+49 = 
# 12 keys in one Octave
# *7 = 84 + 3 + 1 = 88
# starts on A, ends on C

# Save effects in recorded WAV?

# Add a "playback" bus to optionally apply effects to when
# playing back recorded audio.

# play:
# uses capture_save_data and converts to wav (capture_wav)

# Master volume btn / knob
# Make knobs look better (no john godots)

# AudioEffectRecord does not work in Web build
# --effects in general seem to work once Stream is enabled (such as Reverb.)
# --Capture does work.

# Add text to show current value of knobs (in sec)
