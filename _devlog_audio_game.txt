GDSynth:
Real-time audio generator demo using Godot 4.4



Add multiple record track slots.

Add A/S/D/R presets.
0 decay sounds really cool with sus -10

Add text to show current value of knobs (in ms?)

And text edit fields to enter your own values
make it time based instead of samples
save knob presets


Todo:
Add an option to allow press white keys in black key area (disable mouse filter)





Bugs:
Looping still kind of weird
Fix weird buzzing on multiple frequencies (phase issue?)

17 white notes
12 black notes
= 17 + 12 = 29 polyphony (32 will work)
send note to polyphonic player for phase matching?


Changelog:
# Add A/S/D/R functions.
# Add a loop button to loop recorded tracks.
# Add mouse drag / hover events for on-screen buttons
# (Play slide on click+drag)
