GDSynth:
Real-time audio synthesis using Godot 4.4




=====================================================



Todo:

Arpeggiator


EFFECTS:
Fade effects in and out instead of cutting off instantly (help with popping sounds.)

Chorus, Phaser
realistic piano sounds?


METRONOME:
Built-in metronome with adjustable BPM and time signature


KNOBS:
Master volume btn / knob
Make knobs look better (no john godots)


KNOB PRESETS:
Save multiple (named) A/S/D/R knob presets
0 decay sounds really cool with sus -10


MUTLI-TRACK:
Add multiple record/loop track slots.


WAVE TABLE:
More complex oscillators (besides sine wave)
--Frequency modulation -- pulling peaks and valleys tighter together
--Phase modulation, phase distortion, wave folding
--wave table -- sine, triangle, saw, square
smooth morph between waveforms using LFO
--(low frequency oscillator -- changes the waveform over time.)





=====================================================


Stretch:
Add text to show current value of knobs (in ms?)
And text edit fields to enter your own values
Add an option to allow press white keys in black key area (disable mouse filter)



=====================================================

Bugs:

Popping sound on note start -- seems more prominent with low Attack
The pop is intermittent (doesn't always occur.)

Keys held by keyboard repeat when releasing a key held by mouse.

Output latency web: default is 50, max is 100? try tinkering

AudioEffectRecord does not work in Web build
--effects in general seem to work once Stream is enabled (such as Reverb.)


Looping still kind of weird
Fix weird buzzing on multiple frequencies (phase issue?)
--might just be audio clipping due to being too loud when layering multiple notes

17 white notes
12 black notes
= 17 + 12 = 29 polyphony (32 will work)
send note to polyphonic player for phase matching?


=====================================================

Changelog:
# Add A/S/D/R functions.
# Add a loop button to loop recorded tracks.
# Add mouse drag / hover events for on-screen buttons
# (Play slide on click+drag)

# Add multitouch support for mobile (switch to touch screen button?)
# Fix interactions between keypress and touch

# Octave slider (change octaves)
# Pitch bend

# piano--7 octaves (of C) = 49 + 2 = 51
# black: 7 octaves (of B flat) = 49
# 51+49 = 
# 12 keys in one Octave
# *7 = 84 + 3 + 1 = 88
# starts on A, ends on C

# Save effects in recorded WAV?

# Add a "playback" bus to optionally apply effects to when
# playing back recorded audio.

# play:
# uses capture_save_data and converts to wav (capture_wav)
