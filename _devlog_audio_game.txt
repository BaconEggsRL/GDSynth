Add a loop button to loop recorded tracks.
Add multiple record track slots.
Add A/S/D/R functions.
Add A/S/D/R presets.
Fix weird buzzing on multiple frequencies (phase issue?)


Todo:

# Add mouse drag / hover events for on-screen buttons
# (Play slide on click+drag)

Pressing keyboard keys works great (can press same key multiple times.)
But if I use mouse, I can't press the same key I just pressed.
Need to UNTOGGLE button on mouse release.

Update physical keyboard keys to behave the same way (release kills it.)
currently it's a bit buggy, it keeps re-triggering the event for some reason.

17 white notes
12 black notes

= 17 + 12 = 29 polyphony (32 will work)
send note to polyphonic player?

Hey there -- I was thoroughly amused by this video, and used it as inspiration for a game that I made:

The game is called "Cyfraith Cath: Medieval Purrsuits".
The goal: Become the richest cat merchant in Medieval Wales.

(I used some of the arts in this video, hopefully tis OK since the description says they are public domain.)
I had a lot of fun making it, please enjoy. Thanks!
